# Sam's dotfiles

My dotfiles. Probably nothing exciting.

## Installation

To link the files in the repository to those in your home directory, do something like this:

```sh
ln -nfs path/to/dotfiles/zshrc .zshrc
```

I should probably write a script to automate this process--I suspect I'll just end up borrowing someone elses though.

## Thanks

In some way or another, I've taken inspiration from the following dotfiles of others:
