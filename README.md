# Sam's dotfiles

My dotfiles. Probably nothing exciting.

## Installation

To link the files in the repository to those in your home directory, do something like this:

```bash
ln -nfs path/to/dotfiles/zshrc .zshrc
```

I should probably write a script to automate this process--I suspect I'll just end up borrowing someone elses though.
